		<p>Beautiful is better than ugly.</p>

		<p>Explicit is better than implicit.</p>

		<p>Simple is better than complex.</p>

		<p>Complex is better than complicated.</p>

		<p>Flat is better than nested.</p>

		<p>Sparse is better than dense.</p>

		<p>Readability counts.</p>

		<p>Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.</p>

		<p>Although practicality beats purity.</p>

		<p>Errors should never pass silently.</p>

		<p>Unless explicitly silenced.</p>

		<p>In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.</p>

		<p>There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it.</p>

		<p>Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.</p>

		<p>Now is better than never.</p>

		<p>Although never is often better than right now.</p>

		<p>If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.</p>

		<p>If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.</p>

		<p>Namespaces are one honking great idea—let's do more of those!</p>
